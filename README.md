### Synposis
This analysis aims to predict stroke using Bayesian logistic regression. This project is for educational purposes only.

### Data
This analysis makes use of the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) on Kaggle from fedesoriano.

### Required Packages for Analysis
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- pymc
- arviz

### Additional Required Packages
- os
- warnings

### Instructions
1. Fork the repository from [Git](https://github.com/erictria/stroke-analysis-bayes)
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Download the csv file from Kaggle and save as "stroke.csv" in the forked repository
4. Open "Stroke Analysis.ipynb" and run all cells. (Warning: due to the sampling code, running the notebook may take roughly 30 minutes to 1 hour)
